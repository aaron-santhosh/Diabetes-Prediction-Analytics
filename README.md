🩺 Diabetes Prediction System

A machine learning-based system that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various medical attributes.

📌 Overview
This project aims to help healthcare professionals and individuals assess the risk of diabetes using predictive analytics. It leverages machine learning models trained on medical datasets to make accurate, data-driven predictions.

🚀 Features
Predicts diabetes using clinical features like glucose level, BMI, insulin, etc.

Trained and tested on the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset.

Interactive web interface for easy user input (if applicable).

Performance evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Streamlit / Flask (for web interface)

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset
Source: PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset

Attributes:

Pregnancies

Glucose

Blood Pressure

Skin Thickness

Insulin

BMI

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age

Outcome (0 or 1)

⚙️ How It Works
Data is loaded and cleaned (handling missing values, outliers).

Features are scaled using StandardScaler.

Data is split into training and testing sets.

Machine learning models like:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

K-Nearest Neighbors

Support Vector Machine

(Optionally) XGBoost / LightGBM

Best-performing model is chosen based on evaluation metrics.

User inputs are taken via UI and passed to the model for prediction.
